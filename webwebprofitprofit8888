Develop a HitBTC trading bot using CCXT and Python with 0.001 ATOM leveraging CCI signals. Implement long/short orders via subprocess and manage positions without API keys. Include take profit, stop loss, rapid price updates, and logic for entering/exiting trades based on oversold/overbought conditions. Print relevant trading information, ensuring efficiency and profitability not talib do not use api key use bash script subprocess.run(['bash','/buyweb8888.sh'] for placing long and short orders code arguments = ["ATOM", "0.001",side] replace mad with equivalent fast interval price increment place orders profit
