Develop a HitBTC trading bot using CCXT and Python with 0.001 ATOM leveraging CCI signals. Implement long/short orders via subprocess and manage positions without API keys. Include take profit, stop loss, rapid price updates, and logic for entering/exiting trades based on oversold/overbought conditions. Print relevant trading information, ensuring efficiency and profitability not talib do not use api key use bash script subprocess.run(['bash','/buyweb8888.sh'] for placing long and short orders code arguments = ["ATOM", "0.001",side] replace mad with equivalent fast interval price increment place orders profit

Integrate real-time updates from Python to JSON for dashboard.

Implement multiple positions per coin when momentum is right.

Enhance profit calculations for multiple coins simultaneously.

Optimize fast order execution (reduce API latency).

Implement dynamic quantity scaling for larger gains.

Improve CCI algorithm with optional smoothing or hybrid signals.

Add logging & alerts for key events like take profit/stop loss.

I can take this further and deliver a fully integrated version that:

Automatically monitors 30 coins

Executes multiple positions

Updates PHP dashboard in real-time

Calculates total profit dynamically

Uses only cross-margin futures and minimum quantities

If you want, I can write the complete integrated advanced version v1.0 with full real-time dashboard and trade management logic next.
